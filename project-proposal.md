## 1- Capstone Concept - Cultural Clothing Stores

Problem Statement: It is diffcult to find cultural outfits which are hand embroidered. This project will will help merchants sell such clothing items and let customers buy them.

Description of the problem the proposed capstone project would address.

## MVP Feature Set

1.  The website will show a list of merchants and their clothing merchandisze
    - Each merchant will be able to create a store and upload their merchandise information
2.  A customer can log in or browse these merchandise and possibly buy them.
    - The customer will have a cart where they will add their purchased clothing items.

### Potential Additional Features

1.  A customer can purchase a clothihg item from any store

## 2 - Capstone Concept - A website to connect locals with new immigrants

Problem Statement: New immigrants to the U.S. face a lot of challenges when they newly arrive to their new country. While some of them have relatives here to help them out, many face the problem of navigating the system in their new home.

This project will create a website that will help new immigrants get help from local volunteers. For instance, a new immigrant to Seattle area would go to this visit to find someone who can help them practice their English. That Seattle native would have an account on the website where they would have volunteered to offer their service to help out new immigrants to the area.

## MVP Feature Set

1.  The website will enable users to create accounts
    - New immigrants and their hosts will be able to create accounts
2.  A host will be able to post a listing of the kind of service they are going to offer
    - A host can post a listing that they will are willing to volunteer an hour a week to help a new immigrant practice their English.
3.  A new immgirant will come to the website and browse different listings based on different filters.
    - They can search/filter a listing if they are looking for someone to help them practice English skills.


    This is such a fun idea! There isn't anything in the MVP feature set about how the immigrant user would actually contact the host user. I assume you would want that in your MVP, yeah?
    
    - there will be a small chat box open to see if someone is available immediatly to help when click on help or on chat.

    Is there a specific reason why you chose Flask? I would suggest that if you plan to make a full-stack web application using Python, Django would be more helpful in equipping you to do that.

    - Python, Django

    I don't see anything mentioned here about location. Do you want the MVP to be written assuming all users are in one place? Or do you plan to build the MVP with support for multiple locations that can be filtered?

    - support multiple location.

    I see you have Stripe listed but your Feature Set says nothing about payments. Is there intention that there would be something users pay for? If so, can you add that to the Feature Set?

    - no it will be a free thing

    For the final Project Plan, I suggest having an Additional Feature Set as well so you have ideas of what further you can accomplish if you complete the full MVP Feature Set.

 
    I love the idea! It seems like a great way to empower immigrants to get exactly the help they need if they need it!

    - volunteer/immigrate can login and use web for free
    - volunteer image,name and contact details can be viewed
    - volunteer details will have the lauguage they speak and help with
    - contact button will give option to email them, and a chat box will open to chat with an availble person.
    - immigrate can send pic or document or voice/video chat also if immediate help is requored
    - vounteer can fill a form of there timing and hour they can volunteer
    - images or icon on each details so immigrate can see and understand what that means
    - website should simple and easy to use to the one who dont know english 
    - or different languge can be selected to understant what to do.
    - volunteers can post videos which they think can be help for begers to learn english
    - immigrates can post paper/form they cant understand and need help with
    -
