## Problem Statement

New immigrants to the U.S. face a lot of challenges when they newly arrive to their new country. Many face the problem of navigating the system in their new country. So this project will create a website that will help new immigrants get help from local volunteers.

For instance, a new immigrant to Seattle area would go to this website to find someone who can help them practice their English. That Seattle native would have an account on the website where they would have volunteered to help new immigrants.

## Market Research
